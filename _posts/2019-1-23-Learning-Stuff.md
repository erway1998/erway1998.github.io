title: Learning More Stuff
---

Not gonna lie I wrote this post as well as the last one at pretty much the same time.
I'm looking into utilizing jeckyll a bit more for my blog as right now, it's kind of bland.
Again, I'm kinda new to everything thats going on here so it's been a bit tough going through
and learning new interface after new interface and trying to figure out how they connect when
you don't even know everything about them in the first place.
