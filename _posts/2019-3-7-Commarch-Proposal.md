My group for commarch:

Josh Bicking - 	  jhb2345@rit.edu
Giovanni Aleman - ga9494@rit.edu
Derek Erway - 	  dje4179@rit.edu

We will be analyzing Krita for this project. Krita is a free and open source painting program. It is designed to provide a service similar to microsoft paint, paint.net, photoshop, etc. As far as roles go, I will be handling anything to do with the licensing and documentation, Josh will be handling everything related to communication and structure for the project and, Gio will be handling things related to the coding and contribution to the project. In addition to this all of us will help with tasks that don't fall into our categories if needed.
