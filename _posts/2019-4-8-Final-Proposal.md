For the app we're going to create for the sugar environment, we decided on a sort of space themed typing game. By this I mean it will be a game similar to existing ones where you need to type letters or words in a certain time limit. In this case though, we will focus on the equivalent fractions section of the cirriculum. The player will have to either choose between different given fractions or possibly enter a certain number of equivalent fractions in order to go to the next level. Currently we don't necessarily have defined roles as we all sort of plan to help out in each area of the project.
