title: PAX East 2019
---

This last weekend (plus some) I went to Boston to attend PAX East. It's a convention for gaming companies to show off their newest games as well as quite a few indie companies as well. There was plenty of vendors selling tons of cool stuff from peripherals to collectable cards & board games. There was also a variety of talks throughout the 4 days that the convention runs. I went to quite a few of these including some talking about designing games and getting into working on games while being an intern, etc. Although it wasn't the main topic of these meetings open source software and licensing came up fairly frequently. I mostly learned more about some licenses and what comes with taking advantage of open source software that's out there. I had a great time overall and learned a lot from the talks. This was, I believe my 5th year going and I plan to continue.
