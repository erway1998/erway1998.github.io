title: Career Fair & React.js
---

This week was the career fair at RIT so I spend a good amount of my time preparing for that.
When I was applying to dozens of companies online and looking over a lot of the requirements
I realized that a good majority of employers wanted their employees to have experience with React.js.
React.js is a open source library that is used to make designing user interfaces easier and more
streamlined. I have had some experience with React.js in the past in my UI class although I decided
to take a bit of a closer look at it and pretty much just went through a bunch of "hello world"
and other basic style tutorials for React.js to give myself at least some experience with React.js.
