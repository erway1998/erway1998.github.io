Not 100% sure if I did everything correctly here but it should do. Overall most of this stuff was a little confusing to me at first because I've had pretty little experience with anything that we used during this exercise besides github, and even my experience with that is minimal and pretty much boils down to forking, cloning, and commiting to repos.
